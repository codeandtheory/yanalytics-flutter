### Install dependencies

```
dart pub get
```

## Setup githooks (optional)

If you want to make sure you code is ok before running github actions configure githooks:
```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Versioning strategy

We utilize [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

```
{major}.{minor}.{patch}
```

e.g.

```
1.0.5
```

### Branching strategy

We utilize a simplified branching strategy for our frameworks.

* main (and development) branch is `main`
* both feature (and bugfix) branches branch off of `main`
* feature (and bugfix) branches are merged back into `main` as they are completed and approved.
* `main` gets tagged with an updated version # for each release
 
### Branch naming conventions:

```
feature/{ticket-number}-{short-description}
bugfix/{ticket-number}-{short-description}
```
e.g.
```
feature/CM-44-button
bugfix/CM-236-textview-color
```

### Pull Requests

Prior to submitting a pull request you should:

1. Compile and ensure there are no warnings and no errors.
2. Run all unit tests and confirm that everything passes.
3. Check unit test coverage and confirm that all new / modified code is fully covered.
4. Consider using `git rebase -i HEAD~{commit-count}` to squash your last {commit-count} commits together into functional chunks.
5. If HEAD of the parent branch (typically `main`) has been updated since you created your branch, use `git rebase main` to rebase your branch.
    * _Never_ merge the parent branch into your branch.
    * _Always_ rebase your branch off of the parent branch.

When submitting a pull request:

* Use the [provided pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) and populate the Introduction, Purpose, and Scope fields at a minimum.
* If you're submitting before and after screenshots, movies, or GIF's, enter them in a two-column table so that they can be viewed side-by-side.

When merging a pull request:

* Make sure the branch is rebased (not merged) off of the latest HEAD from the parent branch. This keeps our git history easy to read and understand.
* Make sure the branch is deleted upon merge (should be automatic).

### Releasing new versions
* Tag the corresponding commit with the new version (e.g. `1.0.5`)
* Push the local tag to remote
